# HTE MVL

The High Throughput Experiment Material Virtual Library (HTE MVL) provides a means for capturing, 
sharing, and transforming materials data into a structured format that is XML based amenable to transformation to other formats. The data are organized using user-selected templates encoded in XML Schema. These templates are used to create data entry forms. The documents are saved in a non-relational (NoSQL) database, namely MongoDB. The data can be searched and retrieved via several means: by a template-driven web-based form and by a RESTful API call. The system also enables the interconnection of HTE MVL repositories for federated searches.

The software was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

# Disclaimer 

The XML-based schemas provided with the High Throughput Experiment Material Virtual Library are examples of schemas that may be written to represent different aspects of materials data and to demonstrate some of the features that may be used within an XML schema (i.e. including tabular data or composition selection using the periodic table). The schemas do not represent “standard” metadata representations and are specifically release as “as is,” and as such NIST makes no warrant of any kind on the correctness or accuracy of the content of the schemas, nor the fitness of the schemas for any purpose and accepts any liability or responsibility for the consequences of the schemas use or misuse by anyone.

Also note that not all XML-schemas will load properly within the High Throughput Experiment Material Virtual Library.
